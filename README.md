Features
URL Shortening: Easily convert long URLs into unique, short codes.
Database Integration: Stores short links and their corresponding original URLs(i,e mappings) in a MongoDB database.
FastAPI: Built on a modern, high-performance web framework for Python.
Environment Variables: Securely manages database credentials and other sensitive information.

Setup Guidelines:-
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project ,  ensure  the following  must be installed on  localmachine:
-->Python 3.8+
-->Git

Getting Started:-
1. Clone the Repository:

   code :

         git clone https://github.com/snahanku/url_shortner.git
   
          cd url_shortner

3.  Create a Python Virtual Environment:
     It's a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

 
    
          python -m venv .venv

5.  Activate the Virtual Environment:
   
     --> on Windows ,
    
    
              .venv\Scripts\activate

    -->  on mac/linux ,
    
          
    
               source .venv/bin/activate


    Install the Required Libraries:
    
     All project dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

    
    
            pip install -r requirements.txt


    Setting Up Environment Variables

    This project uses an environment variable to securely connect to your MongoDB database.

    Create a file named .env in the root of your project.

    Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to the file using the key MONGO_URI.

    Note: Replace <username>, <password>, <cluster-name>, and <app-name> with your actual MongoDB credentials. Do not hardcode these values directly into your code.



    Running the Project :-
    
       Once you have completed the setup, you can run the application with Uvicorn.

       code :
               uvicorn main:app --reload


        API will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000  and  such an interface can be seen .

      Note : As  this service is hosted , i will be now sharing  the hosted link  and interfaces of testing each  end point .

      The hosted link :

       


     The interface will look like this :

     Link :
             https://url-shortner-web-service.onrender.com
