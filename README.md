Features
URL Shortening: Easily convert long URLs into unique, short codes.
Database Integration: Stores short links and their corresponding original URLs(i,e mappings) in a MongoDB database.
FastAPI: Built on a modern, high-performance web framework for Python.
Environment Variables: Securely manages database credentials and other sensitive information.

Setup Guidelines:-
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project ,  ensure  the following  must be installed on  localmachine:
-->Python 3.8+
-->Git

Getting Started:-
1. Clone the Repository:

     <img width="680" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6afe9044-42b2-42b8-b108-d31e7884a770" />

   code :

         git clone https://github.com/snahanku/url_shortner.git
   
          cd url_shortner

3.  Create a Python Virtual Environment:
     It's a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

 
    
          python -m venv .venv

5.  Activate the Virtual Environment:
   
     --> on Windows ,
    
    
              .venv\Scripts\activate

    -->  on mac/linux ,
    
          
    
               source .venv/bin/activate


    Install the Required Libraries:
    
     All project dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

    
    
            pip install -r requirements.txt


    Setting Up Environment Variables

    This project uses an environment variable to securely connect to your MongoDB database.

    Create a file named .env in the root of your project.

    Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to the file using the key MONGO_URI.

    Note: Replace <username>, <password>, <cluster-name>, and <app-name> with your actual MongoDB credentials. Do not hardcode these values directly into your code.



    Running the Project :-
    
       Once you have completed the setup, you can run the application with Uvicorn.

       <img width="724" height="112" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ca0861-02bf-41fd-82b6-5fb28f0e3f5b" />

       code :
               uvicorn main:app --reload


        API will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000  and  such an interface can be seen .

      Note : As  this service is hosted , i will be now sharing  the hosted link  and interfaces of testing each  end point .

      The hosted link :

       


     The interface will look like this :

     Link :
             https://url-shortner-web-service.onrender.com

    Note : // disclaimer //



   💡 How It Works
The /short endpoint takes a JSON body with a long URL.

It stores the short_code, original_url, and additional metadata in a MongoDB collection.

When a user accesses a shortened URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/<short_code>), the application retrieves the corresponding original URL from the database and performs a redirect.

For data scraping, users must navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/scrape/<short_code>, where <short_code> should be replaced with the value generated by the original shortened URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/<short_code>).

### API Endpoints Overview

0. **`/`**

   * Test endpoint.
   * Returns a message indicating the application home.

1. **`/short`**

   * Shortens a given long URL.
   * Accepts the URL as a query parameter.

2. **`/{short_code}`**

   * Redirects to the original URL associated with the provided `{short_code}`.
   * The `{short_code}` is generated via the `/short` endpoint (e.g., `"J04OwQM"`).

3. **`/data`**

   * Retrieves data stored in the database.
   * Primarily used for testing and debugging purposes.

4. **`/scrape/{short_code}`**

   * Returns metadata in JSON format for the provided `{short_code}`.
   * The JSON response includes fields such as:

     * `short_url`
     * `long_url`
     * `first_click`
     * `last_click`
     * `short_code`

### Additional Features

**📊 Analytics – First & Last Click Tracking**

* Tracks the **first** and **last click** for each shortened URL.
* Implemented using a **decorator**, making it reusable across endpoints (e.g., `/short`, `/scrape`).
* Stores **human-readable timestamps** in the database.

**How it works:**

* Decorator wraps the endpoint.
* Records the first click (if not already set).
* Updates the last click on every access.

**Example:** <img width="630" height="478" alt="decorator-example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f45ea29-0f4d-40f0-b435-49b6ea98bd4b" />

**Usage:** <img width="947" height="103" alt="usage-example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d427bcf3-2ab9-4ce4-a419-df8d61c1b7c9" />
